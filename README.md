## Generic Bubble and Merge Sort Implementation

The following program allows multiple types of objects to be sorted via generic bubble and merge sort methods. The example type used in the program is Float, but other types will also work. Bubble sort is essentially the same as the one created in lecture, while merge sort is my spin on one of the alternative methods we implemented in an earlier lecture.

Running the code will print unsorted and sorted ArrayLists of type Float: one for bubble sort and one for merge sort.
