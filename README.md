## Generic Bubble and Merge Sort Implementation

The following program allows multiple types of objects to be sorted via generic bubble and merge sort methods. The example types used in the program are Float and Integer, but other types will also work. Bubble sort is essentially the same as the one created in lecture, while merge sort builds on one of the alternative methods we implemented in an earlier lecture, separate from the main one that we used originally.

Running the code will print unsorted and sorted ArrayLists of type Float and type Integer to demonstrate that it works for different types.
