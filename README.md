## Generic Bubble and Merge Sort Implementation

The following program allows multiple types of objects to be sorted via generic bubble and merge sort methods. The example types used in the program are Float and Integer, but other types will also work. Bubble sort is essentially the same as the one created in lecture, while merge sort is my spin on one of the alternative methods we implemented in an earlier lecture.

Running the code will print unsorted and sorted ArrayLists of type Float and type Integer for both sorts to demonstrate that it works for different types.
